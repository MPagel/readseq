### <b>Tom Hall</b> (creator, programmer of BioEdit). October 9, 2013: ###

> I wanted to say, I just found your program and found it quite impressive.  It worked flawlessly for me with my first test with nexus export/import.

> I got an email this morning from {redacted} from Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz wondering why BioEdit didn’t work on her new Windows 8 machine.  I wrote back and said that normally it does and asked her to describe the problem she was having.  It turned out she was trying to export nexus format and a message would pop up stating that readSeq is incompatible with 64-bit Windows.  I told her I’d look into whether compatible conversion utilities have been developed because I don’t feel like I have time to try to write more read/write format filters directly into BioEdit.  Your program popped right out on top of a Google search and it worked flawlessly, so I emailed her back pointing to your web link https://code.google.com/p/readseq/

> I also appreciated your explanation for why you don’t care to try to follow up on whether people follow your license agreement.  That’s basically the same reason I don’t bother trying to make money off of BioEdit (too much trouble, involves lawyers, I want people to have access to free tools that work, I’m more interested in my “leave me alone” disclaimer than proactively chasing money, etc).

> I was wondering if it would be OK if I packaged your version of readSeq with a BioEdit installation...

> Either way, thank you for writing a converter that works in 64-bit Windows.  That’s a nice tool to have available.


> Best Regards,

> -Tom

<h3>From a Erik Pollmann August 15, 2012</h3>
<blockquote>Just a thanks for "fixing" BioEdit for 64bit OS for me {readseq.exe}. I can't really state how deeply grateful I am - running BioEdit in a virtual machine on my Win7 system really was a pain. And especially the last version (2.02 - hint, the instructions.txt has not been updated to accommodate the 'junctions no longer required' part) is so easy to use that I can just hand it to others without having to hand-hold the installation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Just again - thank you very much!</blockquote>
