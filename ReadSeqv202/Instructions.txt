basic instructions for installing readseq.exe replacement (from code.google.com) for 64-bit windows

=========Current Version (2.0) Mar 10, 2012=============
Please note that you MUST create a junction to your bioedit temporary files directory.  This is not done automatically because you may have specified an alternative temporary directory within BioEdit.
If you have BioEdit installed to an atypical location (e.g. you installed to D:\Science\BioEdit\) you will either need to a) recompile or b) create a junction at c:\BioEdit\ that points to your install location.

unzip all files, or at least readseq.exe, in this zip file to your BioEdit\apps subdirectory - you may wish to rename or copy your existing readseq.exe first
optional files (not included, but available on this website) should be installed to the same directory with the exception of 7zipMods
unzip the 7zipMods (if downloaded) to your 7-zip program directory
Note: All NEEDED components are presumed to have been included in the downloadable exe.

Required 3rd/4th party applications:
	BioEdit (I use version 7, but should work with earlier versions as well)
	mklink, junction or linkd (see http://www.evga.com/forums/tm.aspx?m=1108749) - likely is preinstalled with your version of windows
	java runtime environment 1.1 or greater - likely is preinstalled with your version of windows.  Otherwise available at java.sun.com.  If you refuse to/can't use java, please use the readseq replacement version 1.

Recommended 3rd/4th party applications:
	7-zip
	Modifications to 7-zip as included on this website (code.google.com)
	flip.exe

Additional installation instructions:
	use mklink (part of the Windows Vista or 7 OS) or equivalent to create the following junction
	 <JUNCTION>     temp [C:\Bioedit\temp]
	e.g. mklink /j temp "C:\Bioedit\temp"
	Optional:
		 <JUNCTION>     7zip [C:\Program Files\7-Zip] - this is not needed if you don't recompile (see below)

Core File descriptions:
	readseq.exe - the Windows application compiled in 7-zip which calls the Java version of ReadSeq
	readseq.jar - should be "included" in the exe, and not needed as a stand-alone file. If it is needed, it's available in the optional files section

	readseq.bat - the source code for this application. Nonessential.

	instructions.txt - this file.  Did you really need to know that?  Nonessential.

Optional Additional Programs:
	flip.exe - Useful for circumstances in which you're pasting from a mac or unix file or terminal window into Windows.  If you don't have this file, an error/warning will be thrown during execution, but the program should still complete its function (if clipboard text format is already DOS).
		available from https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~craig/utility/flip/flip.exe

	7zipMods - again, this goes in your 7 zip application folder. Makeexe creates the 32/64 bit application from a source batch.  The sfx file isn't preinstalled with 7zip.
		Usage: 7zip\MakeExe.bat readseq.bat readseq.jar

	readseq.jar - you'll need this for recompiling, and you may otherwise need it (see above)

=========Old Version (1.0)=============
This section does not apply to the current version, but this description is here for archival purposes.

Required 3rd/4th party applications:
BioEdit (I use version 7, but should work with earlier versions as well)
DOSBox 0.79
mklink, junction or linkd (see http://www.evga.com/forums/tm.aspx?m=1108749)

Recommended 3rd/4th party applications (see source of rs.bat):
7-zip
flip.exe

unzip all files in the "root" of this zip file to your BioEdit\apps subdirectory
unzip the 7zipMods to your 7-zip program directory
Note: I may have been able to use the 7-zip program to package all these exes and batches into a single file, but I haven't tested that at all.

Additional installation instructions:
use mklink (part of the windows vista/7 OS) or equivalent to create the following junctions
 <JUNCTION>     7zip [C:\Program Files\7-Zip] - this is not needed if you don't recompile (see below)
 <JUNCTION>     Bioedit [C:\BioEdit\]
 <JUNCTION>     DOSBox [C:\Program Files (x86)\DOSBox-0.74\]
 <JUNCTION>     temp [C:\Bioedit\temp]
e.g. mklink /j temp "C:\Bioedit\temp"

additionally, on my system I had readseq.bat and readseq.exe as symbolic links to rs.bat and rs.exe respectively as compiling to the full-length name in 7zip was problematic for some reason.


File descriptions:
DBint.bat - does the call to the readseq.exe initially installed with BioEdit (now readsq16.exe).  If recompiled, this file may not strictly be needed - it might be possible to call readsq16 from the DOSBox call in readseq.exe/rs.bat

flip.exe - I didn't write this and it's not absolutely necessary.  I just thought it would be useful for circumstances in which you're pasting from a mac or unix terminal window into Windows.  If you don't have this file, an error/warning will be thrown during execution, but the program should still complete its function (if clipboard text format is already DOS).

nop.bat - does nothing - is just a space-filler for DOSBox compatibility

readseq.exe - the 32 (or 64?) bit application compiled in 7-zip which calls the 32-bit DOSBox

readsq16.exe - the 16-bit readseq.exe installed with BioEdit.  This file is still needed to do the work - the new readseq.exe calls this application

rs.bat - the "source code" of the 32 bit readseq.exe.  This is only needed if you wish to recompile or something is incompatible on your system.

instructions.txt - this file.  Did you really need to know that?

7zipMods - again, this goes in your 7 zip application folder. Makeexe creates the 32/64 bit application from a source batch.  The sfx file isn't preinstalled with 7zip, nor I believe the .exe.  If you have either of these files present, you likely do not
